* Updated Rakefile, README and gemspec.
* Minor updates to the test file and examples.

== 1.4.1 - 17-Jul-2011
* Now works with Ruby 1.9.x. Thanks go to Shura for the patch.
* Refactored the gemspec. Gem building code is now handled by Rake tasks.

  task, and namespaced the gem related tasks.

* Fixed a packaging bug where the libs weren't actually being included! Gah!
  Thanks go to Steven Hilton for the spot.
* Other minor refactorings to the gemspec.

* Fixed RF bug #23477 - Getopt::Std inadvertently raises an error if you
  pass a letter (without a hyphen) as an argument to a switch that matches
  that letter, e.g. "-a a" should be legal. Thanks go to an anonymous user
  for the spot.
* Added tests for RF bug #23477.
* Added Test::Unit 2.x as a prerequisite.

  was smoked out as the result of the alternate hash implementations in
  JRuby and Ruby 1.9.

  test task was updated accordingly.

* The Getopt::LongError class is now Getopt::Long::Error.

* Removed the install.rb file - use the 'rake install' task instead.

== 1.3.5 - 5-Jul-2006
* Fixed a bug where multiple long switches with the same first character
  could cause invalid results.  Thanks go to Michael Campbell for the spot.
* Added documentation to the README file that explains what happens if you
  specify multiple long switches with the same first character and no short
  switch alias.

== 1.3.4 - 7-Mar-2006
* Fixed Getopt::Long so that it can handle embedded hyphens in the long
  form, e.g. --foo-bar.  Thanks go to Mark Meves for the spot.

  embedded hyphens.
